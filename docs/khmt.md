**Personal Interest 2020+.**

(*You can skip this if you're not into competitive programming.*)

Preparing and competing for the ACM-ICPC during my undergrad was fun and exciting but as I (my team) didn't make it to the WF and I had lost interest to continue this sport. It's back baaaaby!

There are a lot, literally a plethora of CP websites, tutorials and stuff to read and do. If you want huge list of it check [this github repo](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming).

I'm going to note down the best of them.

*Online Judges + Contests*

-   <https://codeforces.com/>, very high quality problems, matured platform, huge, active community. Great contests, fast editorials, lookup solutions, etc. Currently the best out there.

-   <https://atcoder.jp/>, a new Japanese platform which is improving and becoming one the best. Kenkoo has made a [nice website](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder#/table/) to see which problems you have solved and categorizes them in difficulty.

-   [https://www.codechef.com](https://www.codechef.com/), with a new management it's working hard to be a great platform.

There are many more such as SPOJ, Peking Online Judge, Timus Online Judge, CS Academy, Hacker-Rank/Earth, etc. where you can practice.

-   [online-judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) has many contest problems and [uHunt](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/) by Steven Halim + [his book](https://cpbook.net/) complement it and are a great resource to practice.

Here are some other forums (no StackOverflow/StackExchange):
------------------------------------------------------------

Reddit is actually one of my favorite programming related forums. People here seem to be nicer/more patient and there is a good combination of pros and noobs. The subreddits I frequent most often are [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/), [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/), and [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)

Another one of my favorites is [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/). That one is more focused around startups and venture capital, but still can be a good read for your everyday programmer. There are a lot of smart people that hang around and interesting discussions occur frequently.

[Quora](http://www.quora.com/) also has a few good forums related to programming. The discussions are organized in a Q&A format and are sorted by topic. It also has the added bonus of being frequented by many mini-celebrities of the computer science world.


Just my two cents. I was always too intimidated to ask forum or SO questions until I read How to Ask Questions the Smart Way. I highly recommend it.
