[Life in the fast lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/) is a great source for development in emergency medicine and critical care. Their "Research and Reviews in the Fastlane" summarize a couple of noteworthy articles in the past month(or week?). And a great ECG library.

[Dr smith's ECG blog](http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.se/) posts interesting cases relating to ECG.

I can recommend a couple of great EM/CC podcasts.

[EMCRIT](http://emcrit.org/) Scott Weingart is the best of the best in the FOAM world.(Free Open Access Medical Education)

[ERcast](http://blog.ercast.org/) an ED view of things. Great podcast as well.

[SMACC](http://www.smacc.net.au/) a conference with podcasts of from the lectures. EM/CC.

[RAGE podcast](http://ragepodcast.com/) The site is down unfortunately. Long and great pods with takes from different specialities on several subjects.

Some journals/sites i can recommend is:

[Critical care](http://www.ccforum.com/)

[Critical Care Medicine](http://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Pages/default.aspx)

[Emergency medicine journal](http://emj.bmj.com/)

[The Trauma Professional's Blog](http://regionstraumapro.com/)

I collect all my feeds in the app "Feedly" on my iphone with the above mentioned sites. It gives a good overview of the recent news and articles with the possibility to read the article/abstract.


[2 Minute Medicine](http://2minutemedicine.com/) bar none. Excellent summaries of all the new journal articles, and it's written by doctors.

Dermnetnz.org for rashes. I’ve never seen better (not even UpToDate), and it is free.

Has anyone mentioned UpToDate yet?? :)


Being Mortal. Or anything else by Atul Gawande, actually. Very relevant to medicine.

House of God is something you should revisit before residency or at least during/after rotations - it might seem more relevant then.

When Breath Becomes Air.

I would consider [The Cochrane Library](http://www.cochranelibrary.com/) to be pretty readable
