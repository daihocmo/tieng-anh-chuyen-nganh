Mình tìm thấy được [đống này trên Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/17j0bz/what_are_your_best_youtube_channelsvideos_for/)

The link to [SketchyMicro](http://www.youtube.com/user/sketchymicro) a few days ago inspired me to make this post. I'm sure we all have some gems lying around in the back of our minds. Sometimes a good video is crazy useful. Here are my favorites:

-   [Shotgun Histology](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7882068A01C370F) on YouTube is incredible. I used it during the entire histo block. This guy also does videos on pathology that I have never tried, but he does an awesome job of keeping histology quick and dirty.
-   This guy's [Handwritten tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/harpinmartin?feature=watch) are great for lots of different topics, check out his channel to see his offerings. It is helpful to draw along with him; it is similar in style to Dr. Najeeb's work.
-   [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssKoVTWV99s) is the best explanation of audio transduction I have ever seen.
