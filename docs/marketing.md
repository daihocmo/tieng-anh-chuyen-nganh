There's lots of great resources out there for digital marketing. Since it's a pretty wide topic, here's a couple you can check out as starting points:

-   Google Skillshop: <https://skillshop.withgoogle.com/>

-   Moz Blog: <https://moz.com/blog>

-   Unbounce Conversion Intelligence Blog: <https://unbounce.com/blog/>

-   Content Marketing Institute: <https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/>

-   Skillshare: <https://www.skillshare.com/browse/digital-marketing>

-   Drift: <https://www.drift.com/blog/>

-   Newsletters you can subscribe to: Hiten Shah's SaaS Weekly, The Daily Carnage, The Hustle.

Other than that, also recommend following and/or having informal chats with digital marketers. Slack groups are a great place for this (and obviously communities like Reddit).

If you're looking to learn a particular area of digital marketing, let me know. Happy to share more resources depending on what you're interested in.
