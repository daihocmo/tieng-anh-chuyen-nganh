Medium.com, Hacker News, Jason Calcaneus This Week in Startups podcast on YouTube, Nathan Latke's pod, Marketing School, Mixergy, Marketing Over Coffee, Hubshots, How I Made This, Guy Kawasaki, Masters of Scale, HBR Ideacast, Nir and Far...



YC blogs or their web podcasts can be quite useful. There are many other startup related podcasts that can be of use - startup, masters of scale, how I built this etc.



The entire YC Library is a goldmine. Going through their startup school program is also a great way to learn first principles behind building businesses. It's primarily tech oriented, but there's a lot of overlap.

Listen to the podcast “how I built this” by Guy Raz. He is an amazing interviewer.

INC is surprisingly good. Also SAAS Mag and then of course the best of them all, news.ycombinator.com which is unbeatable IMO.,
